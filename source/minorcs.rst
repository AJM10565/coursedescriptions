Minor in Computer Science
=========================

Overview
--------

Computers are extremely pervasive in the modern world, and important connections have been established between computer science and virtually ever other field of study. Thus, a computer science minor is a valuable enhancement to majors in other fields, whether in the sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, business, etc.

(A more specific interdisciplinary minor is also offered, see :doc:`minorccf`, and interdisciplinary majors are offered in Bioinformatics, :doc:`bsmcs`, and :doc:`bspcs`.)
