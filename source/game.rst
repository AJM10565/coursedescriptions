Video Game Developer 
======================

(MS in Software Engineering)

Game design and development continues to evolve and grow, now encompassing media, 
engineering, design, and many related facets of hardware and software development. 
Designing, developing, and publishing a competitive game requires a broad 
understanding and clear appreciation of software engineering. Performance, 
optimization, and clear design are critical features of a successful game, 
in particular for mobile platforms. Gaming continues to explore new options 
for design and development, including 
mobile, cloud, machine learning, AI, VR, and recent options for AR.

As a video game designer and developer, 
there are many opportunities to directly apply abstract concepts in a fun, entertaining environment. 
Itâ€™s a lot of work, but also a lot of fun!
