Description
--------------------


This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of
concurrent software systems. Process algebras, formal specification, and
testing are used as tools in the engineering of concurrent systems;
event-based programming frameworks and thread libraries are employed in
the implementation of such systems. Coursework includes several
substantial programming projects (in a language such as Java) involving
applications of concurrency and event-driven programming such as
graphical user interfaces and distributed services using Remote Method
Invocation (RMI).
