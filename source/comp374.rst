DESCRIPTION
--------------------

This is an introductory course in Operating Systems discussing both standalone
and distributed environments. The focus of the course is to understand the
underlying technologies that make contemporary operating systems work
efficiently. We will discuss processes, threads, synchronization, I/O, file
systems, memory management, transactions and system coordination techniques.

Through this course we will discover how these technologies are integrated
into the systems we use today and then utilize these technologies and apply
them to practical applications. This is NOT a programming intensive course,
however, students will be expected to complete some programming in C with
plenty of examples and assistance along the way. You certainly don't need to
know how to program in C today. In addition, the completion of a technical
paper on an OS related subject will also be expected.

Everyone currently in, or planning to enter the IT field should have a grasp
on these components as they effect every area of the day to day operation of
IT technology. Reference systems will include both Linux and Windows.
