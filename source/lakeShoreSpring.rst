:doc:`comp170` 
    | Section 05/05L (5981) Credits: 3; (Hybrid); Lecture
    | Instructor: Harrington,Andrew N
    |Cuneo Hall:311 (Lake Shore) Monday, Wednesday, Friday 10:25AM-11:15
    |Cuneo Hall: 311 (Lake Shore) Friday 11:30AM-12:20 (lab)

	**Notes**
	This is an experimental hybrid version of Comp 170, tested very successfully twice before: It starts in the much easier language Python, which is also highly 	used by professionals. With the central concepts developed simply in that context, it then goes on to transition into Java and add a few concepts not in Python 	(mostly declarations with static typing), plus Java's more verbose syntax. The Java transition is important since Java is also an important language, preparing 	you for Comp 271 in Java. The course uses only free open-source online materials, starting with the Python text, where you can read, test, code, answer 	questions, and check yourself, all in a browser, with little learning curve. The course will be hybrid: after starting in the classroom for a while, many 	classes will be online in Zoom, and all students will need a notebook computer - preferably your own. If you want the traditional Java Comp 170 course, 	register for a different section! This course is restricted to students in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students from other schools specifically wishing 	to enroll in COMP 170 should contact the Computer Science Department to request an enrollment override. Students enrolled in COMP 170-005 (Lecture) will be 	automatically enrolled in COMP 170-05L (Lab). This course is restricted to undergraduate students. Graduate students wishing to enroll in a section of this 	course should contact their departmental graduate advisor.
