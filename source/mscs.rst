MS in Computer Science
=======================

Overview
--------

The MS in Computer Science provides foundations of Computer Science, while
acknowledging that Computer Science is key to algorithms in the sciences.
Other programs in the Computer Science Department with different foci are 
:doc:`msit` and the :doc:`msse`.

Curriculum
----------

This program is for students entering the program in Spring 2014 or later.
If you were enrolled in the program prior to Spring 2014 you may use the older
degree requirements located `here <http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/mscs/oldcurriculum/>`_.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Computer Science students must 
complete the following:

*   Three (3) required courses.
*   Three (3) restricted electives. 
*   Four (4) courses or 12 credits that are general electives.

Major Requirements (9 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following three courses are required by the program:

* :doc:`comp417`
* :doc:`comp413`
* :doc:`comp460`

The Graduate Program Director may approve the replacement of 
:doc:`comp413` by an additional course on the Restricted Electives list in cases 
where the student's primary program focus is not on software development.

Restricted Electives (9 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
MS-CS students must also take three courses from the following list:

* :doc:`comp433`
* :doc:`comp436`
* :doc:`comp439`
* :doc:`comp442`
* :doc:`comp443`
* :doc:`comp453`
* :doc:`comp464`
* :doc:`comp471`
* :doc:`comp473`
* :doc:`comp474`

General Electives (12 Credits)

Thesis Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MS students in the Computer Science degree program (only) 
may elect the MS thesis option.

Course work is strongly recommended over the thesis option, 
especially for those not planning on a research-oriented career. Many students
pursuing the thesis option, therefore, 
would be considering a PhD program at another institution. 

Students wishing to do a thesis should discuss this option as early as 
possible with the GPD. 

See the `Graduate Student Handbook <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html/ms_programs.html#thesis-option/>`_ for more information.
