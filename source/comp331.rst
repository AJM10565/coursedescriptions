Prerequisites
---------------------

**Theoretical Foundations**

|math201| or :doc:`comp363`

**Programming Foundations**

:doc:`comp125` or :doc:`comp150`, or :doc:`comp170` or :doc:`comp215` (or equivalent)

Description
--------------------

This course introduces the formal foundations of cryptography and also
investigates some well-known standards and protocols. The intended audience is
senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The course will include
topics selected from the following: information-theoretic security, private
key encryption, DES, public key encryption, background on modular arithmetic,
RSA, hashing and message authentication codes (MACs), digital signatures, DSS,
key distribution and management, PGP, network security, and Fiat-Shamir
protocol.

Outcome
----------------------

Students will gain an understanding of cryptosystems widely
used to protect data security on the internet, and be able to apply the ideas
in new situations as needed.
