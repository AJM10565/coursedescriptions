Description
--------------------

Object-orientation continues to be a dominant approach to software
development. This intermediate programming-intensive course studies the
use of classes and objects with an emphasis on collaboration among
objects.

**Course Topics**

-  Data Structures of various types – linear vs. nonlinear, indexing vs.
   non-indexing, position vs. value-oriented
-  Advanced Java, e.g. interfaces, annotations, exceptions, generics,
   collections, boxing/unboxing, array objects
-  Object Modeling – UML, use cases and activity diagrams, class
   diagrams, archetypes, interaction diagrams
-  Design by contract, interfaces, refactoring & generalization, design
   patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Composite, Strategy, Iterator, Abstract
   Factory, Visitor, …)
-  Agile Development Process – evolutionary design, test-driven
   development, refactoring, …
-  Tools – Eclipse, Subversion, JUnit, JMock, Ant, …
-  Techniques – object pooling, garbage collection, performance
   profiling (NetBeans)

Outcome
----------------------

A thorough understanding of the principles of object-orientation:
abstraction, delegation, inheritance, and polymorphism; exposure to
basic design patterns; programming experience in mainstream
object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java.

You will take your software development abilities to the next level by
building on your knowledge of data structures.

You will learn to design and implement more complex programs using good
software engineering practices, including:

-  Designing with interfaces and composition
-  Design patterns
-  Refactoring
-  Test-driven development (TDD)
