Description
--------------------


This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the
hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern
computer system. The course is particularly geared towards topics of
interest to a programmer, i.e., topics that affect the performance,
correctness, or utility of user-level programs. Since this investigation
is best carried out using the C programming language, the course will
include some instruction in C for programming familiar with Java.
