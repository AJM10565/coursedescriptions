PhD preparation 
======================================================

(MS in Computer Science with the thesis track)

Core computer science areas are important, and research involving them is even more important.  The prime question for PhD references is “Does this person have high potential for independent research?” and this must be demonstrated in engagement with the academic community through papers, presentations, and conference posters. Engagement with research faculty is strongly encouraged on entering the program.
