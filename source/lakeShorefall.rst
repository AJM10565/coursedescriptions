    **Notes:**
    Introduction to Natural Language Processing. This course provides an introduction to the field of natural language processing (NLP). NLP is a field that
    lies at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It is concerned with computational approaches to analyzing,
    generating, and understanding human language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to communicate with people the same way that people
    communicate with each other.
    
    
    
    This course will introduce the students to the problems, methods, and applications of NLP. Topics will include information retrieval, sentiment analysis,
    machine translation, document classification, and question answering. We will also cover the underlying theory from probability, statistics, and machine
    learning that are crucial for the field. Whether you are interested in the intersection between the humanities and computer science or want to understand
    how Google works, this course will help you on your way.  Combined with COMP 488-002.
