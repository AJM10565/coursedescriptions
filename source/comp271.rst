COMP 271: Data Structures
=========================

Credit Hours
-----------------------

3

Prerequisites
------------------------------

:doc:`comp170` or :doc:`comp215` 

:doc:`comp163` or |math201| (corequisite)


Description
--------------------


This continuation of :doc:`comp170` introduces the concepts of data
abstraction and data structure, including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and
trees. The issues of implementing a data structure in a language such as Java
are examined using classes, arrays, and linked structures. Sorting and
searching techniques are analyzed. The concepts of correctness and efficiency
of algorithms are developed. Time/space comparisons of iterative algorithms
with recursive algorithms are made. The course includes several major
programming projects. A weekly lab component is required.
