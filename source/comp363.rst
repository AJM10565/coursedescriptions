Description
--------------------

The central goal of this course is for students to gain basic skills in
designing and implementing efficient and effective computer programs.
The course begins by developing models and mathematical tools for
measuring the efficiency of algorithms. Then students are introduced to
a variety of useful data structures and to algorithms for a variety of
fundamental problems. Finally, the course will provide an introduction
to classification of computational problems into different complexity
classes. The course will include a small amount of actual programming in
addition to theoretical analysis.
