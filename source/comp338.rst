Description
--------------------


This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of
multi-tiered server-based software systems. Each tier is studied along
with the pertinent mechanisms: markup languages in the client tier, web
application frameworks in the web tier, and server-side components in
the business logic and persistence tiers. Pervasive issues such as
integration, testing, security, and performance are discussed.
Coursework includes several substantial programming projects (using a
platform such as Java 2 Enterprise Edition).
