"This is an experimental hybrid version of Comp 170, tested very successfully twice before: It starts in the much easier language Python, which is also"
"highly used by professionals. With the central concepts developed simply in that context, it then goes on to transition into Java and add a few concepts not"

"language, preparing you for Comp 271 in Java. The course uses only free open-source online materials, starting with the Python text, where you can read,"
"test, code, answer questions, and check yourself, all in a browser, with little learning curve. The course will be hybrid: after starting in the classroom"
